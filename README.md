This is a ReactJS project bootstrapped with `create.react.app`
# Getting Started
First, change to the necessary directory

Then make sure you have react and it's dependencies installed and open the development server:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

If necessary, install `react-router` with the following on the command line:
```
npm install react-router-dom
```

Open [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result

You can edit the page by opening the src folder and within it, opening any of the files to modify the code.

To visualize your changes, make sure to save the file; it'll then automatically reload the page and display your changes.
